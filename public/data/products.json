    "description": "This blackened fish tacos recipe is easily manageable for a weeknight dinner. 'Blackening' is a flavorful technique for cooking fish, and it's fast. The slaw is creamy, crunchy, spicy, and wonderful, with shredded red cabbage and white onions tossed with a puree of sour cream, jalapeño peppers, cilantro, and lime juice. Blackened fish is a Cajun dish invented in late 1970s by New Orleans chef Paul Prudhomme when he was head chef at Commander's Palace. His blackening technique was an instant hit in the South and quickly spread in popularity to the rest of the country.",
    "comment":"If we go to McDonald's I just have to get a big mac, I love that it has 2 patties and I can still eat it, sometimes a bit messy but always good and can't go wrong with the big mac sauce.",

    "description": "Jamaican Escovitch fish recipe is a must-try! This Escovitch fish recipe is crispy fried fish topped with a spicy pickled vegetable medley. So easy to make and it taste amazingly good. A great dish especially if you like spicy food! Escovitch fish is crispy fried fish soaked in a spicy pickled sauce made with lots of white onion, carrot strips, pimento berries (allspice) and scotch bonnet pepper. You can also add bell pepper to the vegetable medley but I did not for this recipe.",
    "comment":"I grew up eating the big mac or the mcchicken from Mcdonalds. Definitely one of my top two burgers that I can never seem to get sick of but I hate that its almost $6 for the burger now. Definitely not worth it, but if there are coupons or promotions, I usually pick the big mac.",

    "description": "Fish pie is usually made with fresh and smoked fish (for example cod, haddock, salmon, or halibut) or seafood in a white sauce[1] or cheddar cheese sauce made using the milk the fish was poached in. Hard-boiled eggs are a common additional ingredient.[citation needed] Parsley or chives are sometimes added to the sauce. It is oven-baked in a deep dish but is not usually made with the shortcrust or puff pastry casing that is associated with most savory pies (e.g. steak and kidney pie).",
    "comment":"Two all beef patties and that special sauce go perfect together. The Big Mac is now my all time favorite I thought I would have to cut it in half but it was too delicious I couldn’t save it or share it. Definitely going back again for another this week",

    "description": "This braised chicken recipe is emblematic of the Basque region’s affection for colorful, peppery stews and is adapted from a version served by Spanish chef Sébastien Gravé. While paprika works in a pinch, it’s worth seeking out the flakier, lightly spicy, and more enigmatic Espelette pepper which is traditional in the region. Find it in your local spice shop, or order it online.",

The sweet tart consists of a filling of butter, sugar, syrup, and egg, baked in a pastry shell until the filling is semi-solid with a crunchy top.[1] The butter tart should not be confused with butter pie (a savoury pie from the Preston area of Lancashire, England) or with bread and butter pudding. Recipes for the butter tart vary according to the families baking them. Because of this, the appearance and physical characteristics of the butter tart – the firmness of its pastry, or the consistency of its filling – also vary.",
    "comment":"Had this for the first time today and it was my least favorite McDonald's offering. Drowning in sauce that added a questionable flavor to the beef that hid in the bread that hid in the lettuce. Reminded me of eating burgers in the UK, which is not a good thing.",

The sauce can be made at any stage and kept covered in the fridge, then re-heated. To make the ice cream, simply put everything into a bowl and use an electric hand mixer to whisk all the ingredients together thoroughly. Then pour the mixture into the polythene freezer box and place it in the coldest part of the freezer. After about 2 hours, or when the edges are starting to freeze, remove it and use the hand mixer to give it another good mix and break down any ice crystals. Return to the freezer, then repeat the whisking after 3 more hours.",

All they had to due was put the patties from the quarter pounder in the original–good meat to burger ratio, increase in price appropriate, no new packaging, no new buns, they missed it entirely.",

    "description": "Key lime pie is an American dessert pie made of lime, egg yolks, and sweetened condensed milk. It may be served with no topping, topped with a meringue topping made from egg whites, or with whipped cream; it may be cooked in a pie crust, graham cracker crust, or no crust.[2] The dish is named after the small Key limes, which are more aromatic than the common Persian limes, and which have yellow, not green, juice. The filling in a Key lime pie is also yellow, largely because of the egg yolks. The filling is made similarly to a Magic Lemon Cream Pie, by simply mixing the ingredients without cooking: the proteins of the egg yolks and condensed milk and the acidic lime juice curdle, thickening the mixture without baking. Today, key lime pies are usually baked to pasteurize the eggs and thicken the filling further.",
